# C++ Text Adventure Game
A text adventure game coded in C++ and played through a CLI (Command Line Interface).
Run the .exe to start playing! Optionally, you can also compile and link it yourself.

# Motivation
I really enjoyed my text adventure coursework in university but didn't have enough time to fully create it in a way that I really wanted. This is my first personal project which doesn't include all my university projects. This was a great opportunity for me to improve my C++ and use a Kanban Project Management methodology on Jira.

Inspired by one of my courseworks and the use of Jira was inspired by https://github.com/Nazar2347/Snake!
